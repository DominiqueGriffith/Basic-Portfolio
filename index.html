<h1>About Me</h1>
</br>


<p>
   <br>Greetings! My name is Dom. I was born in Philadelphia, PA on October 12th, 1990. I grew up in the Northwestern section of the city, Chestnut Hill, until I graduated high school in 2008. 
   I went to college at American University in Washington, DC, where I studied International Affairs for 4 years. Always having a love for learning new languages and cultures, I studied abroad for a year in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.</br>
</p>
<p>
   <br>Upon returing from Rio, I graduated college and moved to New York City. In New York I worked as a Creative Project Manager, aiding teams or graphic designers, coders, and marketers in developing sucessful marketing campaigns.</br>
</p>
<p>
   <br>In 2018 I decided to take break from New York's fast-pace lifestle, and I embarked on a journey to teach English at the Universidade Estadual de Santa Cruz in the small city of Ilh√©us, Brazil. 
   My return to Brazil enabled me enhance my Portuguese skills and further explore my interest in Latin American history and literature.<br>
</p>
<p>
   <br>I finally returned to the State's in 2019 and I'm now looking to retun to the corporate world as a Front End Developer.<br>
</p>
<p>
   <br>When I'm not working or traveling you can catch me reading a  book or watching a movie about a remote coutnry or learning a new langauge on Duolingo. You'll also find me lost at thought drawling or playing videogames (Resident Evil 2 Remake was so good!)<br>
</p>
